# "DMVCFramework - the official guide" Examples
This repository contains all the "DMVCFramework-The Official Guide" examples updated for the latest version of DMVCFramework.

DelphiMVCFramework is a Delphi framework which allows to create powerful RESTful and JSON-RPC servers without effort At the time of writing DMVCFramework is the most popular open source Delphi project on [Github](https://github.com/danieleteti/delphimvcframework) with the biggest developers community. After the collaboration with an editor for my first 3 books (Delphi Cookbook Series), I decided to switch and start a new self publishing adventure. After 2 years of hard work the first edition of [*DelphiMVCFramework - the official guide*](https://leanpub.com/delphimvcframework) has been published in august 2020 targeting version dmvcframework-3.2.1-carbon.

While the content is still relevant for the current version, some examples could not compile because some methods has been deprecated and then removed or just classes/types have been moved between different units. For these reasons I decided to update all the examples and release them as open source.

Please, consider that current framework version could offer a faster/shorter/easier way to do what the examples shown in 2020. The reason of this repository is to just make examples compatible with the current version of dmvcframework.

> Buy “DMVCFramework - the official guide” as [hardcopy on Lulu](https://www.lulu.com/en/en/shop/daniele-teti-and-jim-mckeeth/delphimvcframework-the-official-guide/hardcover/product-r26e8e.html) or buy as [e-Book on LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/delphimvcframework)

In the next months I'll start to work on an updated version of the guide with updated and new contents. This version will contains many of the new features introduced in DMVCFramework since 2020.

Up to then, have fun with these updated examples.
